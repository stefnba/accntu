# Icons

## Icon Management Guidelines

### Core Principle
**ALL icons must be managed through the centralized icon component library at `src/components/icons.tsx`**

### Rules

1. **Never import icons directly from icon libraries**
   - ❌ `import { LuUser } from 'react-icons/lu'`
   - ❌ `import { User } from 'lucide-react'`
   - ✅ `import { User } from '@/components/icons'`

2. **Add new icons to the central library first**
   - Before using any new icon, add it to `src/components/icons.tsx`
   - Use consistent naming conventions (PascalCase, descriptive names)
   - Import from react-icons/lu (Lucide) for consistency

3. **Icon naming conventions**
   - Use descriptive, semantic names (not technical names)
   - Example: `Dashboard` instead of `LuLayoutDashboard`
   - Example: `Security` instead of `LuLock`

4. **Adding new icons process**
   ```tsx
   // In src/components/icons.tsx
   import { LuNewIconName } from 'react-icons/lu';
   export const SemanticName = LuNewIconName;

   // In your component
   import { SemanticName } from '@/components/icons';
   ```

5. **Icon library structure**
   - Group related icons together
   - Keep exports alphabetical when possible
   - Use consistent import source (prefer react-icons/lu)

### Current Icon Library
The centralized icon library is located at `src/components/icons.tsx` and includes:
- User, Security, Notification, Settings, Appearance
- Dashboard, Wallet, Database, Search

### Benefits
- Consistent icon library across the entire application
- Easy to swap icon libraries if needed
- Centralized control over icon usage
- Better tree-shaking and bundle optimization
- Easier maintenance and updates

### Enforcement
- All icon imports should come from `@/components/icons`
- No direct imports from icon libraries allowed
- Add icons to central library before using them
- Use semantic naming for better code readability
