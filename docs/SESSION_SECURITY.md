# Session Security Implementation Plan

## Overview

This document outlines a security approach for monitoring and managing user sessions, focusing on detecting suspicious changes in IP addresses and user agents. This represents a future enhancement to improve the application's security posture.

## Current Implementation

Currently, we're tracking session activity by:
- Updating `lastActiveAt` timestamp when sessions are used
- Storing the IP address and user agent with each session

## Proposed Security Enhancements

### 1. Security Risk Assessment

We can implement a tiered risk assessment system for session activity:

```typescript
// Risk levels
enum SecurityRiskLevel {
    NONE = 'none',
    LOW = 'low',
    MEDIUM = 'medium',
    HIGH = 'high',
    CRITICAL = 'critical'
}

// Event types to track
enum SecurityEventType {
    IP_CHANGE = 'ip_change',
    USER_AGENT_CHANGE = 'user_agent_change',
    MULTIPLE_LOGINS = 'multiple_logins'
}
```

### 2. Security Evaluation Logic

For each authenticated request:
- Compare current IP and user agent to previous values
- Assign risk levels based on changes:
  - IP address changes: MEDIUM risk (potential location change)
  - User agent changes: LOW risk (different browser/device)
  - Impossible travel detection: HIGH risk (login from distant locations in short time)

### 3. Risk Response Actions

Implement graduated responses based on risk level:

| Risk Level | Action |
|------------|--------|
| LOW | Log activity for audit |
| MEDIUM | Log warning, consider notifying user |
| HIGH | Force re-authentication, notify user |
| CRITICAL | Lock account, require manual verification |

### 4. Audit Trail

Create a dedicated `security_audit_logs` table with:
- Timestamp
- User ID
- Session ID
- Event type
- Risk level
- Event details (previous/current values)
- IP geolocation data

### 5. Notification System

- Email alerts for medium+ risk events
- In-app notifications for security events
- Admin dashboard for security monitoring

## Implementation Stages

1. **Stage 1:** Create security assessment service
2. **Stage 2:** Implement audit logging
3. **Stage 3:** Add user notifications
4. **Stage 4:** Develop admin security dashboard
5. **Stage 5:** Implement advanced risk detection (ML/AI)

## Code Example

The security assessment service would look something like:

```typescript
export const evaluateSessionSecurity = async ({
    sessionId,
    userId,
    currentIp,
    currentUserAgent
}) => {
    // Get previous session data
    const sessionRecord = await getSessionById(sessionId);

    // Compare values and assess risk
    if (previousIp !== currentIp) {
        // Log and take appropriate action
        return {
            riskLevel: SecurityRiskLevel.MEDIUM,
            eventType: SecurityEventType.IP_CHANGE,
            requiresAction: true,
            message: `IP address changed from ${previousIp} to ${currentIp}`
        };
    }

    // Return assessment result
}
```

## Notes for Implementation

- All security checks should be asynchronous to avoid adding latency
- Consider rate-limiting security notifications to prevent alert fatigue
- Implement proper IP geolocation for better risk assessment
- Consider accessibility and usability when implementing re-authentication flows
