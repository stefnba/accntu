# Session: Improve Transaction Deduplication System

**Session Start:** 2025-01-08 11:20  
**Status:** Planning

## Session Overview

Improve the transaction deduplication process in `/src/lib/duckdb/transaction-transform-manager.ts`. The current system generates keys using MD5 hashing of transaction fields (name, date, amount, currency) but incorrectly flags legitimate transactions as duplicates when they share identical information but are actually separate transactions (e.g., recurring charges, multiple identical purchases on the same day).

## Current System Analysis

### How Deduplication Currently Works

1. **Key Generation**: MD5 hash of concatenated columns (Description, Amount, Date, Currency)
2. **Storage**: 25-character truncated hash stored in `transaction.key` field
3. **Constraint**: Unique index on `(userId, key, isActive)` prevents duplicates
4. **Detection**: Bulk SQL-based duplicate checking using PostgreSQL extension

### Current Issues

- **False Positives**: Legitimate transactions with identical details flagged as duplicates
- **Common Scenarios**: 
  - Recurring subscriptions (Netflix, Spotify) on same date
  - Multiple identical purchases (coffee shop visits)
  - Recurring bill payments
  - Multiple transactions at same merchant on same day

## Objectives

- Reduce false positive duplicate detection
- Maintain performance of bulk SQL operations
- Preserve existing architecture and patterns
- Allow configuration per bank account
- Handle edge cases without breaking existing functionality

## Development Plan

### Phase 1: Enhanced Key Generation Strategy

**Approach**: Multi-factor key generation with fallback mechanisms

1. **Primary Key Strategy**: Include additional discriminating factors when available
   - Bank-specific transaction IDs (`providerTransactionId`)
   - More precise timestamps (time component if available)
   - Transaction sequence numbers
   - Account-specific references

2. **Secondary Key Strategy**: For transactions without unique identifiers
   - Generate sequence-based keys for identical base transactions
   - Include position/order information from import file
   - Use row number as tie-breaker

3. **Configurable Key Columns**: Allow bank-specific key generation rules
   - Define primary vs secondary key columns in bank configuration
   - Support optional columns that enhance uniqueness when present

### Phase 2: Duplicate Detection Refinement

**Approach**: Multi-stage validation with user control

1. **Exact Duplicate Detection**: Current system for truly identical transactions
2. **Potential Duplicate Detection**: Flag suspicious similarities for user review
3. **User Decision Framework**: Allow users to mark transactions as "not duplicates"
4. **Learning System**: Store user decisions to improve future detection

### Phase 3: Database Schema Enhancements

**Approach**: Extend existing schema without breaking changes

1. **Additional Key Fields**: 
   - `primaryKey`: Enhanced key with additional factors
   - `baseKey`: Original key for backward compatibility
   - `sequenceNumber`: For handling identical transactions

2. **Duplicate Metadata**:
   - `duplicateGroup`: Link related similar transactions
   - `userConfirmed`: Track user decisions on duplicates
   - `confidenceScore`: Algorithmic confidence in duplicate detection

## Technical Implementation

### File Changes Required

1. **`/src/lib/duckdb/transaction-transform-manager.ts`**
   - Enhance key generation logic
   - Add multi-factor key creation
   - Implement sequence-based fallback

2. **`/src/features/transaction/server/db/schema.ts`**
   - Add new key fields (optional, non-breaking)
   - Create indexes for new fields
   - Maintain backward compatibility

3. **`/drizzle/scripts/seed/data/global-bank-account.ts`**
   - Update bank configurations with enhanced key strategies
   - Define priority columns for key generation

4. **`/src/features/transaction-import/server/services/transaction-parser.ts`**
   - Update parser to use new key generation
   - Handle enhanced duplicate detection

## Alternative Approaches Considered

### Option 1: Time-Based Differentiation
- **Pros**: Simple, uses existing data
- **Cons**: Not all imports have precise timestamps
- **Verdict**: Include as part of multi-factor approach

### Option 2: Sequence-Based Numbering
- **Pros**: Handles identical transactions reliably
- **Cons**: Requires import order preservation
- **Verdict**: Use as fallback mechanism

### Option 3: User-Configurable Rules
- **Pros**: Maximum flexibility for different use cases
- **Cons**: Complex UI, potential user confusion
- **Verdict**: Implement as advanced feature

### Option 4: Machine Learning Approach
- **Pros**: Could learn from user behavior
- **Cons**: Overkill for this problem, adds complexity
- **Verdict**: Not suitable for current scope

## Recommended Approach - REVISED

**Issue Analysis**: After tracing the flow, I realize there are fundamental problems with my initial approach:

1. **connectedBankAccountId is NOT available** in the `transformData()` method - it's only available later in `bulkCheckDuplicates()`
2. **Sequence numbers are not deterministic** across imports - same file imported twice would generate different keys
3. **Including connectedBankAccountId in keys is redundant** - duplicate checking already scopes by this field

## **Better Approach: Use Row Position for Deterministic Differentiation**

The key insight is that we need a **deterministic differentiator** that's consistent across imports:

```typescript
// Modify the key generation to include row position
const keyExpression = `SUBSTR(MD5(${hashColumns} || '|' || ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY 1)), 1, ${idLength})`;
```

**Problems with this approach**:
- Still not deterministic if file order changes
- Doesn't solve the core issue of legitimate identical transactions

## **Actual Problem**: 
The issue isn't with key generation - it's that **identical transactions should be allowed**. Current system assumes identical key = duplicate, but that's wrong for scenarios like:
- 3 coffees same day
- Monthly recurring charges
- Multiple identical purchases

## **Real Solution**: 
We need to change the **duplicate detection logic**, not the key generation. The system should:
1. Keep current key generation (it's actually working correctly)
2. Allow users to mark "duplicates" as legitimate separate transactions
3. Or use additional context (like balance changes) to differentiate

**Conclusion**: The user's suggestion to modify key generation won't solve the fundamental issue and introduces new problems.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Modify Key Generation Logic**: Update the `transformData` method to always include `connectedBankAccountId`
2. **Add Sequence Number Logic**: Implement ROW_NUMBER() approach for identical transactions
3. **Test**: Validate with real transaction data showing duplicate scenarios
4. **Deploy**: Single code change, no migration needed

## Progress

- [x] **Modify transformData method** to accept connectedBankAccountId parameter
- [x] **Update key generation logic** to include connectedBankAccountId in hash
- [x] **Implement ROW_NUMBER() approach** for counting identical transactions  
- [x] **Update transaction-parser.ts** to pass connectedBankAccountId to transformData
- [x] **Test the solution** with example data containing identical transactions
