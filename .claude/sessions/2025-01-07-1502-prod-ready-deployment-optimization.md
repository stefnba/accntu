## Current State Analysis ✅

### Docker Configuration Review
**Main Dockerfile** (`/Dockerfile`):
- Uses multi-stage build with `oven/bun:1.0.29` base image
- Stages: deps → builder → runner
- Configured for Next.js standalone output
- **Issues Identified**:
  - Missing security hardening
  - No health checks
  - No non-root user setup
  - Large base image (not using alpine)
  - DuckDB native bindings complexity

**Docker Compose** (`/docker-compose.yml`):
- Basic setup with app + PostgreSQL 16 Alpine
- **Issues Identified**:
  - Hardcoded credentials in environment
  - No secrets management
  - Missing resource limits
  - No health checks
  - Development-focused configuration

**Deploy Configuration** (`/deploy/docker-compose.yml`):
- Appears to be incomplete/outdated
- References non-existent services structure
- Not aligned with current application structure

### Application Architecture
- **Next.js 15** with App Router and standalone output ✅
- **Bun** as package manager and runtime
- **PostgreSQL** with Drizzle ORM
- **DuckDB** for data processing (complicates containerization)
- **Complex environment variables** (75+ variables with smart client/server detection)

### Critical Production Issues Found

1. **Security Vulnerabilities**:
   - Containers running as root
   - No secrets management
   - Hardcoded credentials
   - Missing security headers

2. **Performance Issues**:
   - Large container images
   - No resource limits
   - Missing caching optimizations
   - No health checks

3. **Deployment Complexity**:
   - DuckDB native bindings platform-specific
   - Complex environment variable setup
   - No database migration strategy
   - Missing monitoring/logging

## Detailed Development Plan

   - Performance monitoring

## Implementation Strategy

### Recommended Approach: **Incremental Optimization**

**Why this approach:**
- Minimizes deployment risk
- Allows testing at each stage
- Maintains application functionality
- Enables gradual performance improvements

**Alternative considered: Complete rewrite**
- Higher risk, longer timeline
- Could introduce regressions
- Not necessary for production readiness

### Critical Dependencies to Address

1. **DuckDB Native Bindings**: Major containerization challenge
2. **Complex Environment Setup**: 75+ variables need careful management
3. **Bun Runtime**: Ensure production stability and optimization
4. **Next.js Standalone**: Optimize for container deployment

### Success Metrics

- Container image size reduction (target: <500MB)
- Startup time improvement (target: <30s)
- Security scan passing (zero critical vulnerabilities)
- Resource efficiency (target: <512MB RAM, <1 CPU)
- Zero-downtime deployment capability
