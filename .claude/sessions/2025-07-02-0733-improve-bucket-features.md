# Improve Bucket Features - Many-to-Many Relationship

_Session started: 2025-07-02 07:33_

## Session Overview

This session focuses on enhancing the bucket functionality by implementing a proper many-to-many relationship between transactions and buckets. The current implementation needs to be refactored to support advanced features like split tracking, SplitWise integration, and better transaction-bucket associations.

## Objectives

- Create a junction table between transactions and buckets with enhanced metadata
- **Constraint**: One transaction can only be assigned to ONE bucket (enhanced one-to-many)
- Add additional columns: created, updated, isRecorded (SplitWise), split share, notes, etc.
- Add bucket tracking fields: total transactions, total amount, paid amount, open amount
- Implement validation to prevent multiple bucket assignments per transaction
- Update all related queries and services to reflect the new schema
- Maintain backward compatibility where possible
- Improve data integrity and relationship modeling

## Detailed Development Plan and Approach

### Phase 1: Database Schema Design

1. **Create junction table `bucket_transaction`**:

    - `id` (CUID2 primary key)
    - `transactionId` (foreign key to transaction table, UNIQUE constraint for one-bucket-per-transaction)
    - `bucketId` (foreign key to bucket table)
    - `splitShare` (decimal for split percentage/amount - future use)
    - `isRecorded` (boolean for SplitWise sync status)
    - `notes` (optional text for relationship-specific notes)
    - `createdAt` (timestamp with timezone)
    - `updatedAt` (timestamp with timezone)
    - `isActive` (boolean for soft delete)

2. **Update bucket schema to include computed/tracking fields**:

    - `totalTransactions` (computed field - count of active transaction relationships)
    - `totalAmount` (computed field - sum of all transaction amounts)
    - `paidAmount` (tracked field - amount recorded to SplitWise)
    - `openAmount` (computed field - totalAmount minus paidAmount)
    - Consider adding `currency` field for multi-currency support

3. **Update existing schemas**:
    - Remove direct foreign key from transaction to bucket
    - Add proper indexes for performance (especially on transactionId for uniqueness)
    - Set up proper relations in Drizzle schema
    - Add unique constraint on `transactionId` in junction table

### Phase 2: Database Queries Refactoring

1. **Transaction queries**:

    - Update `getById` to include bucket relationship via junction table
    - Update `getAll` to handle bucket filtering
    - Create `getByBucket` query
    - Update create/update operations (no direct bucket assignment)

2. **Bucket queries**:

    - Update `getById` to include computed fields (totalTransactions, totalAmount, openAmount)
    - Update `getAll` to include transaction counts and amounts
    - Add queries to calculate and refresh bucket statistics
    - Update participant-related queries

3. **Junction table queries**:
    - Create CRUD operations for transaction-bucket associations
    - Add validation queries to check existing assignments
    - Create queries for SplitWise sync status updates
    - Add query to get bucket assignment for a transaction (should return max 1)

### Phase 3: Service Layer Updates

1. **Transaction services**:

    - Remove direct bucket assignment logic
    - Create methods to get bucket assignment via junction table
    - Add bucket filtering support

2. **Bucket services**:

    - Add methods to calculate and update bucket statistics
    - Update bucket retrieval to include computed fields
    - Handle transaction assignment/removal via junction service
    - Add methods to update paidAmount for SplitWise integration

3. **New junction service (bucketTransaction)**:
    - **Assign transaction to bucket**: Validate transaction isn't already assigned
    - **Reassign transaction**: Remove old assignment, create new one
    - **Remove assignment**: Soft delete junction record
    - **Update SplitWise status**: Mark isRecorded and update bucket paidAmount
    - **Validation**: Ensure one transaction per bucket constraint

### Phase 4: API Endpoints Updates

1. **Transaction endpoints**:

    - Update existing endpoints to handle bucket relationships
    - Add endpoints for bucket assignment/removal

2. **Bucket endpoints**:

    - Update to return transaction relationships
    - Add bulk transaction assignment endpoints

3. **New junction endpoints**:
    - Create endpoints for managing split shares
    - Add SplitWise sync endpoints

### Phase 5: Client-Side Updates

1. **API hooks**:

    - Update existing hooks to handle new relationship structure
    - Create hooks for junction table operations

2. **Components**:
    - Update forms to handle split shares
    - Add UI for SplitWise integration status
    - Update data tables to show relationships

## Alternatives Considered

### Option 1: Direct Foreign Key (Current)

**Pros**: Simple, straightforward
**Cons**: Limited to 1:1 relationship, no split tracking, no additional metadata

### Option 2: Many-to-Many Junction Table (Chosen)

**Pros**: Flexible, supports splits, metadata, future extensibility
**Cons**: More complex, requires migration, additional queries

### Option 3: JSON Column Approach

**Pros**: Simple schema, flexible data structure
**Cons**: Poor queryability, no referential integrity, harder to maintain

## Current State Analysis

### Existing Implementation

- **Current Schema**: Direct foreign key `bucketId` in transaction table (one-to-many)
- **Relations**: `bucket.transactions: many(transaction)` and `transaction.bucket: one(bucket)`
- **Queries**: Bucket queries don't fetch transactions; transaction queries don't include bucket relations
- **Services**: Basic CRUD operations, no complex relationship management
- **Usage**: The relationship exists but is minimally utilized in current queries

### Key Files to Modify

1. **Schema**: `/src/features/bucket/server/db/schemas.ts` and `/src/features/transaction/server/db/schema.ts`
2. **Queries**: `/src/features/bucket/server/db/queries/bucket.ts` and `/src/features/transaction/server/db/queries.ts`
3. **Services**: `/src/features/bucket/server/services/bucket.ts` and `/src/features/transaction/server/services.ts`
4. **API**: Bucket and transaction endpoints will need updates
5. **Client**: API hooks and components will need updates

## Implementation Notes

- Follow existing patterns from other features (transaction-import, bank)
- Use Drizzle ORM patterns consistently
- Implement proper error handling and validation
- Add comprehensive tests for new functionality

## ✅ Implementation Complete!

### What's Ready to Use:

**🔗 API Endpoints Available:**

- `GET /buckets` - Get all buckets with computed statistics
- `GET /buckets/:id` - Get bucket with totalTransactions, totalAmount, openAmount
