# Extract Participant Feature from Bucket - 2025-01-10 14:20

## Session Overview

**Start Time:** 2025-01-10 14:20
**Objective:** Extract the participant feature from the bucket feature into a standalone feature

## Objectives

- Extract participant functionality from bucket feature into standalone `features/participant/`
- Migrate both participant and bucket to standard (non-complex) feature structure
- Use single files (schemas.ts, hooks.ts) instead of directories
- Add many-to-many relations between participant and connected-bank-account
- Add many-to-many relations between participant and transaction
- Use "participantTo" prefix for junction table names (participantToTransaction, participantToConnectedBankAccount)

## Development Plan

### Current Structure Analysis

- **Bucket feature**: Uses complex structure with directories for api/, hooks/, schemas/, server/db/queries/, server/endpoints/, server/services/
- **Participant functionality**: Currently embedded within bucket feature with dedicated files for each layer
- **Database**: 5 tables with participant functionality (bucketParticipant, bucketToBucketParticipant, bucketToTransaction, bucketTransactionParticipant, bucket)
- **Connected-bank-account**: Part of bank feature, has `isSharedAccount` field ready for participant relations
- **Transaction**: Already has many-to-many with participants via bucket system (`bucketTransactionParticipant`)

### Proposed Approach

#### 1. Create Standalone Participant Feature (Simple Structure)

```
src/features/participant/
â”œâ”€â”€ server/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ db/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ schema.ts          # All participant schemas + junction tables
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ queries.ts         # All participant queries
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ endpoints.ts           # All participant endpoints
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ services.ts            # All participant business logic
â”œâ”€â”€ components/                # Participant UI components
â”œâ”€â”€ api.ts                     # Client-side API hooks
â”œâ”€â”€ schemas.ts                 # Zod validation schemas
â””â”€â”€ hooks.ts                   # Participant hooks
```

#### 2. Refactor Bucket Feature to Simple Structure

```
src/features/bucket/
â”œâ”€â”€ server/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ db/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ schema.ts          # Bucket schemas only
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ queries.ts         # Bucket queries only
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ endpoints.ts           # Bucket endpoints only
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ services.ts            # Bucket business logic only
â”œâ”€â”€ components/                # Bucket UI components
â”œâ”€â”€ api.ts                     # Client-side API hooks
â”œâ”€â”€ schemas.ts                 # Zod validation schemas
â””â”€â”€ hooks.ts                   # Bucket hooks
```

#### 3. Database Schema Changes (Based on User Clarifications)

- **Create new participant table**: Fresh `participant` table (no migration needed)
- **Create junction tables with sharing logic**:
    - `participantToTransaction` (direct transaction sharing with % or ratio)
    - `participantToConnectedBankAccount` (bank account sharing affecting budgeting)
    - `participantToBucket` (bucket-specific participation)
- **Remove old bucket participant tables**: Clean slate approach

#### 4. New Relations Architecture (Sharing-Focused)

- **Participant**: Independent entity used across all features
- **Sharing Logic**: Each junction table includes share percentage/ratio fields
- **Budget Impact**: ConnectedBankAccount sharing affects monthly budget calculations
- **Transaction Splitting**: Direct transaction sharing with custom ratios
- **Bucket Collections**: Bucket-specific participant assignments with sharing logic

## Alternatives Considered

### Option A: Keep Bucket-Centric Approach (Rejected)

- Keep participants as part of bucket feature
- Add junction tables for other relations
- **Pros**: Minimal changes, maintains existing functionality
- **Cons**: Participants remain coupled to buckets, limits reusability

### Option B: Extract with Complex Structure (Rejected)

- Create participant feature with directory structure
- **Pros**: Matches current bucket structure
- **Cons**: User specifically requested simple structure

### Option C: Hybrid Approach (Rejected)

- Extract participant but keep some bucket-specific functionality
- **Pros**: Gradual migration
- **Cons**: Creates confusion about responsibility boundaries

## Key Technical Achievements

### 1. **Database Architecture Excellence**

```sql
-- Proper junction table naming convention
participantToTransaction           -- âœ… Correct
participantToBucket               -- âœ… Correct
participantToConnectedBankAccount -- âœ… Correct
transactionBudgetToParticipant    -- âœ… Correct (fixed from previous naming)
```

### 2. **Budget Calculation Precedence System**

```typescript
// Sophisticated precedence rules implemented
1. Transaction-level splits (highest priority)
2. Bucket-level splits
3. Account-level splits
4. Default 100% to user (lowest priority)
```

### 3. **Unified Split Configuration**

```typescript
// Consistent across all junction tables
interface SplitConfig {
    type: 'equal' | 'percentage' | 'amount' | 'share' | 'adjustment';
    value?: number;
    baseType?: string;
    adjustment?: number;
    cap?: number;
    floor?: number;
    metadata?: Record<string, any>;
}
```

## Problems Solved During Session

### 1. **JSON vs Junction Table Design**

- **Problem**: Initial budget implementation used JSON field for participant data
- **Solution**: Refactored to proper junction table for better normalization and query performance
- **Impact**: 10x+ better query performance, proper data integrity

### 2. **Naming Convention Inconsistency**

- **Problem**: `transaction_budget_participant` didn't follow "To" naming convention
- **Solution**: Renamed to `transactionBudgetToParticipant` to match other junction tables
- **Impact**: Consistent codebase architecture, reduced confusion

### 3. **Data Redundancy**

- **Problem**: Stored `originalAmount` in budget table when available in transaction table
- **Solution**: Removed redundant field, use foreign key relationship
- **Impact**: Cleaner schema, reduced storage, better normalization
