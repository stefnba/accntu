# Mobile Application Development

## Objectives

Develop a companion mobile application for Accntu that provides core financial management functionality on-the-go. Focus on transaction viewing, quick expense entry, receipt scanning, and real-time budget tracking while maintaining data synchronization with the main web application.

## Development Plan

### Phase 1: Mobile Architecture Foundation

1. **Technology Stack Selection**
   - React Native with Expo for cross-platform development
   - Share API client code with web application
   - Implement offline-first architecture with sync capabilities

2. **Project Structure Setup**
   - Create `mobile/` directory in project root
   - Configure shared TypeScript types between web and mobile
   - Set up shared API client and schema validation

### Phase 2: Core Mobile Features

3. **Authentication & Security**
   - `mobile/src/features/auth/`
   - Biometric authentication (Face ID, Touch ID, fingerprint)
   - Secure token storage with device keychain
   - PIN/passcode fallback for device access

4. **Transaction Management**
   - `mobile/src/features/transaction/`
   - Transaction list with infinite scroll and search
   - Quick expense entry with camera integration
   - Offline transaction queuing with sync when online

5. **Receipt Scanning & OCR**
   - `mobile/src/features/receipt/`
   - Camera integration for receipt capture
   - OCR processing for amount and merchant extraction
   - Manual correction interface for OCR results

### Phase 3: Mobile-Optimized UI

6. **Navigation & Layout**
   - `mobile/src/navigation/`
   - Tab-based navigation for core features
   - Gesture-based interactions (swipe, pull-to-refresh)
   - Dark mode support matching web application

7. **Dashboard & Widgets**
   - `mobile/src/features/dashboard/`
   - Quick spending overview with charts
   - Recent transactions and pending imports
   - Budget progress indicators

8. **Responsive Transaction Entry**
   - `mobile/src/features/quick-entry/`
   - Floating action button for quick expense entry
   - Voice-to-text for transaction descriptions
   - Smart category suggestions based on context

### Phase 4: Advanced Mobile Features

9. **Offline Capabilities**
   - `mobile/src/services/offline/`
   - Local SQLite database for offline storage
   - Background sync with conflict resolution
   - Offline-first transaction creation and editing

10. **Push Notifications**
    - `mobile/src/services/notifications/`
    - Budget alerts and spending notifications
    - Import completion notifications
    - Scheduled spending reminders

11. **Location-Based Features**
    - `mobile/src/services/location/`
    - Automatic location tagging for transactions
    - Merchant recognition based on GPS coordinates
    - Spending analysis by location

### Phase 5: Integration & Sync

12. **Data Synchronization**
    - `mobile/src/services/sync/`
    - Real-time sync with web application
    - Conflict resolution for concurrent edits
    - Incremental sync for performance

13. **Camera & File Management**
    - `mobile/src/services/media/`
    - Receipt photo storage and management
    - Cloud backup for receipt images
    - Photo compression and optimization

### Infrastructure Updates

14. **API Enhancements**
    - Add mobile-specific endpoints for optimized data transfer
    - Implement webhook system for real-time notifications
    - Add file upload endpoints for receipt images

15. **Backend Services**
    - OCR service integration for receipt processing
    - Push notification service setup
    - Mobile device registration and management

## Alternatives Considered

### 1. Progressive Web App (PWA)
**Pros**: 
- Single codebase with web application
- Easier maintenance and deployment
- No app store approval process
- Cross-platform by default

**Cons**: 
- Limited native device feature access
- Reduced performance for complex operations
- Limited offline capabilities
- Poor camera and file system integration
- Less native user experience

### 2. Native iOS/Android Development
**Pros**: 
- Maximum performance and native features
- Best user experience on each platform
- Full access to device capabilities
- Platform-specific optimizations

**Cons**: 
- Separate codebases for each platform
- Higher development and maintenance cost
- Longer development timeline
- Need for platform-specific expertise
- Difficulty maintaining feature parity

### 3. Flutter Development
**Pros**: 
- Single codebase for both platforms
- Good performance and native feel
- Growing ecosystem and community
- Google backing and support

**Cons**: 
- Different technology stack from web app
- Limited code sharing with existing TypeScript
- Smaller talent pool
- Additional learning curve
- Less mature ecosystem compared to React Native

**Chosen Approach: React Native with Expo**
This approach provides:
- Maximum code sharing with existing TypeScript/React web app
- Access to native device features through Expo APIs
- Faster development cycle with hot reloading
- Easy deployment and OTA updates
- Strong community and ecosystem
- Cost-effective cross-platform development
- Familiar development environment for the team

The React Native approach allows leveraging existing API infrastructure, shared type definitions, and business logic while providing a native mobile experience.
